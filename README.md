# Scripts for 3D LED Christmas tree decoration.

## requirements:
Python >3.7

## python packages:
pip install numpy scipy opencv-python

## running with blender:
it might be convenient to run blender with the system python:

  PYTHONPATH=$(which python) blender --python-use-system-env

if additional packages (like scipy, etc) are needed by the respective program

## TODO
- Automatic writing of config.py
- Automate running a sequence of programs with fixed time each
- more programs (this is always a to-do ;))
